# Executive Summary

## Goal
This initiative translates legal requirements from the EU AI Act into technical, framework-independent disclosure elements that can be reused across compliance and development contexts.

## Problem
Most AI regulations are expressed in legal language, making them difficult to implement in engineering workflows.

## Solution
We create a reusable disclosure model structured by category, risk level, and stakeholder role, supported by templates and checklists.

## Outcome
- Technical glossary of legal terms
- Disclosure templates and tools
- Use-case-agnostic compliance model
